# Lab Scenario

In this hands-on lab, you will be an environment administrator for Fabrikam helping to adopt the Power Platform. You have been assigned responsibility for ensuring that Fabrikam’s employees are able to build Power Apps applications and flows using Power Automate to help them be productive. At the same time, you are expected to ensure that Fabrikam’s data and security policies are followed.
Some of Fabrikam’s employees have already started experimenting with the Power Platform so your first task is to get an understanding of what is already in use.
Next, you will be taking steps to put some baseline security policies in place to implement Fabrikam’s data and security policies.  

1.	Understand the basics of security and administration 
1.1.	Azure Identity and Access Management 
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service that authenticated Power Platform experiences rely on. 
Exercise #1 – Explore existing Power Platform usage. 
TODO – recycle Exercise #1 from this admin in a day workshop.
Exercise #2 - Specify which users may operate in an environment. 
Scenario: 
In this exercise, you will audit Production environments to see which have security groups bound to them, controlling which users can operate in the environment, and create a new environment bound to a new security group.

Task 1: Review existing environments
1.	Logged in with the Lab Admin account in an in-private browser session navigate to https://aka.ms/ppac  and select Environments.
2.	Review the list of environments. These are the environments that are available for you to manage.
