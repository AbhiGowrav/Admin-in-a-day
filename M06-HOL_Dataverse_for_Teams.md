# Admin in a day

## Dataverse for Teams (Optional)


### Lab Scenario

 In this hands-on lab you will create a Power App in a team and see how
 to publish it to your team. You will also share with colleagues
 outside your team to see how broad distribution apps work.

### Lab Test Environment

 This hands-on lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup
 for multiple students to complete the Admin in a day series of hands
 on labs.

 You will be assigned one or more users to use to complete the tasks.

 a Service Administrator will already be completed. Your account will
 only be an environment administrator.
