## Exercise 1: Admin Analytics for Power Apps

### About

Analytics for the environment admin is available at the Microsoft Power Platform admin center. The admin reports provide a view into environment level usage, errors, service performance to drive governance, and change management services to users. These reports are available for canvas apps only and not available for model-driven apps

### Task 1: Explore the Power Apps analytics

1. Go to the Power Platform admin center using your tenant administrator credentials (https://aka.ms/ppac).   
   
   a. Reminder: Your credentials are in the **"Environment Details"** tab.

3. **Usage** report is the default reports seen by the logged in environment admin. It provides total app launches and daily active users across all apps in the environment. Admins can  
     filter the view with attributes like device platform, player version, country/region, state, and city.

     end users of the app.

>**Note**: Once enabled, this feature aggregates data from environments across all regions in your tenant and copies it into the default environment region for tenant-level reporting. A tenant-level administrator role is required for one-time operation of granting consent for tenant-level analytics.

5. The Overview tab displays a message indicating that tenant-level analytics has been enabled. Typically, these reports are displayed within 24-48 hours of enabling the feature.
