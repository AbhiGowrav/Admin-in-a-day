## Exercise 1: Create an internal Microsoft Power Platform hub

### Scenario

At the heart of growth is a community, a place for people to collaborate, share ideas, and discover new ways to apply technology to achieve more. A community is a safe place to ask questions to share tacit knowledge and expand skill sets. Organizations that have succeeded at creating a growing community of makers provide tools such as Yammer or Microsoft Teams groups, regular events and speaking opportunities, and foster an environment of ongoing learning.
They make sure that every person in the organization can come together at regular intervals to socialize, share their knowledge, and explore new possibilities. Leaders who want to create a digital culture will put a framework in place for the community inside their organization to break down geographic and organizational silos.
